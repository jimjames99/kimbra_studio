You probably know that Kimbra has several pieces in her jewelry collections specifically themed for pets. You may not have
noticed, but we do not yet offer these pieces in the Kimbra ClickPLUS platform.

It's not that we don't love pets, and it's not that we discourage pet portraits for your clients. Far from it.

The real reason is that we automate many parts of the process of photoshopping your portraits into the jewelry pieces to create
the offers for your clients. We have removed Kimbra's pet-themed pieces so that we don't accidentally create an offer
of the bride's mother on a pooch bracelet -- that would be bad.

Studios that specialize in pet portraits love to use us because pet portraits look great in regular jewelry pieces.

When we have a foolproof process for ensuring that the mother of the bride does not end up in the wrong place, we'll
introduce Kimbra's line of pet-themed jewelry.
