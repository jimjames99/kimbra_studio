The holiday season is a great time to reconnect with your clients from the past year.
It's an excellent excuse to remind them about the magic memories captured by your portraits.

We have a special program for the holiday season to help you rekindle the excitement that
your clients had about their photo session. Go back through your shoots for the entire year
and create a new session for each client -- be sure to select the category Holiday Ornaments --
and upload a handful of the most iconic portraits you did for them.

Bear in mind the usuable area for holiday ornaments tend to be smaller than most photo jewelry so we'll
crop tightly and look for group shots. But don't worry about that because, as always, we do all the work
for you in creating the offers.

We'll create a special mailing consisting of just holiday ornaments. These ornaments will remind your
clients, their friends, and families of your photographic business, year after year.

If you are an existing PPP Program participant (you know who you are!) please contact us before creating one of these
sessions - we want to make sure there is no conflict with your pricing strategy.

Happy Holidays from us here at ClickPLUS!
