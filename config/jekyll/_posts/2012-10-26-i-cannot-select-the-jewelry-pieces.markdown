The Kimbra ClickPLUS process is pretty simple: you upload a few pictures, we take care of everything else. But sometimes
studios complain that they cannot select the jewelry pieces themselves.

We designed it that way because studio after studio told us that they want to focus on photography and running their
studio, instead of spending way too much time fussing with photo jewelry offers.

To make it as fast for studios as possible, we delay selecting the jewelry pieces that we'll use for your offer until we
start working on the photoshopping of the offers themselves. We don't want you to take time to select the perfect jewelry
piece appropriate for the portrait you just uploaded - we'll do that for you. And it's faster if you just leave it to us.

Of course, you can use Kimbra's PPP program (Professional Photography Program) if you want to perform all of the steps
yourself: upload the portraits, select the jewelry piece, composite it into the piece, collect the payment from the client,
process the payment, handle customer support, shipping, etc. But who has the time?

Let us do all the hard work in the process of creating gorgeous photo jewelry pieces for your clients and building
marketing programs that spread the word of your studio's quality to your client's families and friends. yes!
