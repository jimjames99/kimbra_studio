Wedding studios are under a lot of pressure to complete their photography package quickly. The bride, the mother of the bride,
the families of the bride and the groom, everyone wants to see those pictures. The reality is that it takes significant time
to winnow the thousand or more pictures to a presentation package. The clients are impatient and don't appreciate the
amount of work that's required, nor the studio's reluctance to release portraits before they are all complete and crafted to
the studio's quality standards.

Some studios have realized that they can provide significant satisfaction to their clients' impatience by sending them a
photo jewelry offer. The offers are gorgeous and captivate the clients and their families. Because the portraits are
greatly reduced in size (typically to an inch across), the studio does not need to spend _any_ time on post-processing
or enhancements. Nor does the studio need to worry about artistic considerations involved in the cropping and positioning
of the jewelry piece - we do all of that for them.

Even better than reducing their client's impatience, the studio's branding is forwarded to all the friends and families
of the delighted and excited client. That word-of-mouth marketing is gold to studios who want to increase their business.
