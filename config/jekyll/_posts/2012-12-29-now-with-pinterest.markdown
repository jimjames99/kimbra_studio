Pinterest is the largest collection of curated portraits on the Internet - that is HUGE viral potential for your studio's business.
You probably already have a Pinterest strategy for out studio - your goal is to reach your local share of the over 15 million US
users on Pinterest. Need more [stats](http://www.searchenginejournal.com/pinterestingly-enough-interesting-pinterest-stats/45328/)
to convince you?

We have added a Pinterest button to every offer we generate for your clients. That allows them to pin it to Pinterest with one click.
Your clients can comment with more details, but we default to a comment of "Gorgeous photo jewelry from _your studio name and website_"
This allows all of their friends and family, and everyone who views their Pinterest board to find you and be inspired by your work.

We are sensitive that some studios might not be ready to reach hundreds of potential customers in their local area by
posting images of their work for influential people to see. (Ok, that was tongue-in-cheek -- studios might not be comfortable with
clients posting their much-reduced images to Pinterest and that's valid.) So we allow studios to opt out of this feature on
their studio page.
