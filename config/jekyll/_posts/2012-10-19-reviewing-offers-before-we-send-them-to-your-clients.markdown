You can easily review the offer pieces we created for your client and the offer email and the mini-website they click through
for more details and purchase. But you don't see those until after we have created and sent the offers.

We are thinking of adding a checkbox that will allow you to review the offers before we send them. We'll only send the
offers to your client after you have reviewed them. We'll probably send you an email as soon as the offers are ready for
review.

After you are used to the quality of work we do, you can select _skip individual reviews_ to have us send the offer
emails as soon as they are ready. That removes a step for you and speeds everything up.

What do you think of that proposal? Let us know in the comments or contact us directly via chat or email.
