Thanksgiving is a great time to reach out to your clients and remind them of the power of families to connect through
portraits.

While we are gearing up to provide regular promotional campaigns for your clients using the sessions you have uploaded
in the past, you can still do your own guerilla marketing. Simply upload a previous family portrait session and let us
do the work to compose the offer emails to send to your clients.

You'll notice that our offer emails do not carry seasonal or event-driven marketing messages to your clients.
We simply let your brand speak for itself and let your portraits evoke their own powerful emotions. That's why you can
confidently upload baby pictures one day and restored archival portraits of your client's grandparents the next day
knowing that both will be delivered in a neutral way without overt marketing messages.

The important thing is that your studio delivers a real emotional connection for your clients - Kimbra's ClickPLUS program
is just the vehicle to help you deliver that. Thanksgiving is a great time to upload some family portraits and rekindle
a connection with your clients.
