Just released! Your clients can now swap out the jewelry piece in their offer. That means that they have full freedom to
create their heirloom piece exactly the way they want it.

We also include rings (sizeable) and jewelry accessories like chains and charms.

We still do not support the studio selecting which pices should be used in the offer. That's because we want you to focus
on your business, not designing jewelry -- that's our job!

As always, if you have any special requests, go ahead and upload the session portraits and email us or use the instant message
chat feature on the site, or just call us. We are here to help you make your business successful.
