      under the age of eighteen (18), we strongly encourage you not to include any identifying information (such as the
      individual's name or address) with such Submission. </p>

    <p>None of the Submissions will be subject to any obligation, whether of confidentiality, attribution or otherwise,
      on our part and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions. You acknowledge and agree that
      we may (but are not obligated to) do any or all of the following, at our discretion: (a) monitor and/or filter any
      Submissions (including without limitation by means of blocking or replacing expletives or other language that may
      be deemed harmful or offensive); (b) alter, remove, or refuse to send, transmit or otherwise use any Submission

      thereof, to any third party in order to operate the Services; to protect us and our affiliates, distributors,
      partners, licensors, advertisers and sponsors, and our and their directors, officers, employees, consultants,
      agents, other representatives, and users; to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests; to enforce
      these Terms; or for any other reason or purpose. </p>

    <p>Please note that we may also provide users with an automated method of reporting Submissions that they believe to
      be inappropriate. If we do provide such a method, Submissions that are reported more than a certain number of
      times may be automatically removed from the Service; provided, however, that Kimbra ClickPLUS has no obligation to
      remove Submissions in response to user reports or requests. Kimbra ClickPLUS is not responsible for, and will have
      no liability for, the removal or non-removal of any Submissions from the Service. We recommend you keep back-up
      copies of your Submissions on your hard drive or other personal system, as the Service is not intended to be used

      ClickPLUS. A large volume of material is available in our Forums and Forum participants may occasionally post
      messages or make statements, whether intentionally or unintentionally, that are inaccurate, misleading or
      deceptive, and provide content that may be objectionable to you. We neither endorse nor are responsible for such
      messages, statements, or content, or any opinion, advice, information or other utterance made or displayed on the
      Service by third parties, whether such third parties are users of the Service or others. The opinions expressed in
      the Forums reflect solely the opinions of the participants and may not reflect the opinions of Kimbra ClickPLUS.
      We are not responsible for any errors or omissions in articles or postings, for hyperlinks embedded in messages or
      for any results obtained from the use of such information. Under no circumstances will Kimbra ClickPLUS, any of
      our affiliates, distributors, partners, licensors, advertisers or sponsors, and/or any of our or their directors,

      the Service. </p>

    <p>Some features of the Service enable you to send and receive transmissions. You acknowledge and agree that Kimbra
      ClickPLUS has no responsibility or liability for any transmissions, and/or any content included in such

  </li>

  <li><span class=sub>Making Purchases</span><br>

    <p>If you wish to purchase any products or services through the Service, we will ask you to supply certain
      information applicable to your purchase, including, without limitation, payment and other information. Any such
      information will be treated as described in our <a href="/help/privacy.jsp">Privacy Policy</a>. All information
      that you provide to us or our third party payment processor must be accurate, current and complete. YOU REPRESENT
      AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE ANY CREDIT CARD(S) OR OTHER PAYMENT MEANS USED TO INITIATE ANY
      TRANSACTION. You agree to pay all charges incurred by you or any users of your account and credit card (or other
      applicable payment mechanism) at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. You will also be responsible
      for paying any applicable taxes relating to your purchases. Verification of information applicable to a purchase
      may be required prior to our acceptance of any order. </p>

    <p>Descriptions, images, references, features, content, specifications, products, price and availability of any
      products or services are subject to change without notice, and our current prices can be found on the Service. We
      make reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of our products, including the applicable colors;
      however, the actual color you see will depend on your computer system, and we cannot guarantee that your computer
      will accurately display such colors. The inclusion of any products or services on the Service at a particular time
      does not imply or warrant that these products or services will be available at any time. It is your responsibility
      to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal and international laws (including minimum age
      requirements) in regard to the possession, use and sale of any item purchased through the Service. By placing an
      order, you represent that the products ordered will be used only in a lawful manner. We reserve the right, with or
      without prior notice, to limit the available quantity of or discontinue any product or service; to honor, or
      impose conditions on the honoring of, any coupon, coupon code, promotional code or other similar promotions; to
      bar any user from making any or all purchase(s); and/or to refuse to provide any user with any product or
      service. </p>

    <p>Title and risk of loss for any purchases pass to you upon our delivery to our carrier. When you place an order,
      we will not charge you until we ship the items ordered. We reserve the right to ship partial orders (at no
      additional cost to you), and the portion of any order that is partially shipped may be charged at the time of
      shipment.</p></li>

  <li><span class=sub>Copyright Issues</span><br>

    <p>Kimbra ClickPLUS is committed to protecting copyrights and expects users of the Service to do the same. The
      Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that
      material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith
      that any material used or displayed on or through the Service infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may
      send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the
      following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner
      of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been
      infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such
      works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity,
      and information reasonably sufficient to allow us to locate the material on the Service; (d) the name, address,
      telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining
      party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the
      copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate
      and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an
      exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement
      has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices
      must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.copyright.gov/ for details.
      DMCA notices and counter-notices regarding the Service should be sent to: </p>

      operation of such Third Party Properties, or (b) the privacy or other practices of such Third Party Properties.
      The fact that the Service directs you to such Third Party Properties does not indicate any approval or endorsement
      of any Third Party Properties. We direct you to such Third Party Properties only as a convenience. You are
      responsible for the costs associated with such Third Party Properties, including any applicable license fees and
      service charges. Accordingly, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with the terms of use and practices of
      any such Third Party Properties. </p>
