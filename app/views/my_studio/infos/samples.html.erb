    <%= t('my_studio.infos.samples_offer_email.body_html') %>
  </li>
  <li>Your client receives the email, opens it, and clicks on an offer that interests them.</li>
  <li>
    They go to your <i>minisite</i>. Your minisite is a branded website that contains just the offers that were created
    for your client and nothing else. It's a special little world dedicated to your brand, your portraits, and their
    offers.
  </li>
  <li>Your client can forward their offer email or links to your minisite to their friends and family for them to admire
    your portraits composed into Kimbra's jewelry.
  </li>
  <li>
    If your client likes what they see, they can purchase on the minisite and we take care of all the details.
    We send you a commission check as soon as your commissions exceed $100 on the first of the month.
  </li>
  <li>
    We also take care of answering questions, handling issues and returns... everything! Your client or their friends
    can contact you at any time to set up their next photo session.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can contact us any time with questions, advice on portraits for jewelry, anything!

<h2>Minisite pages</h2>

<p>
  These samples show the main minisite pages for a dummy studio called Studio One and illustrate how the key pieces of
  client communication use your branding (your logo, your website colors, your website fonts, your website font colors)
  and with your contact details. For now, the samples show Studio One's branding but all your client communications show
  <i><b>your branding</b></i>.
</p>

  that uses your branding. Click on the <u>Back to Samples</u> link to return here.

<p>
  You can view exactly the email and minisite for each of the offers sent to your clients from the Photo Sessions page.
