        Kimbra's heirloom photo jewelry has been around for over a decade since she started her business in Littleton,
        Colorado.
        Her eye for design and love for photographers has forged many creative partnerships.
      </p>

      <p>
        She has been looking for a way to help photo studios for many years.
      </p>

      <p>
        So she built a platform that makes it easy for studios to reach out to their clients in several ways:
        <ol>
          <li>create personal jewelry offers</li>
          <li>Kimbra manages and supports the entire process</li>
          <li>these gorgeous offer emails get posted to FB and tweeted about</li>
          <li>extending the studio's brand by word of mouth</li>
          <li>support for ongoing offers for important holidays and anniversaries</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Larry and Jim are the developers and they live in Land O'Lakes and Clearwater, Florida.
      </p>

      <p>
        Candi and Rebecca work directly with studios to help them get set up and working smoothly.
